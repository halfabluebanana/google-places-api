Her exceptional professionalism and attention to detail truly stood out during my shopping experience, making a significant impact on my overall enjoyment and satisfaction.\n\nHer genuine approach to customer service set the tone for the rest of my visit. Denisse's ability to anticipate my needs and provide tailored assistance was akin to a seasoned professional, ensuring that my shopping experience was seamless and efficient. Her knowledge about the products was impressive, and she took the time to explain the benefits of the items, which was incredibly helpful.\n\nDenisse's attention to detail was evident in everything she did. Whether it was recommending complementary products, or addressing any concerns I had, her meticulous approach left no room for error. I felt confident in her guidance and appreciated her thoroughness in ensuring that my questions were answered and my needs met.\n\nWhile interacting with Denisse, it became clear to me that her skills are underutilized in her current position. She possesses a natural talent for leadership and an ability to inspire those around her. Her calm demeanor, coupled with exceptional organizational skills, would undoubtedly make her a valuable asset in a managerial role.\n\nI couldn't help but compare her to another impressive employee I encountered at the 96th Street Branch, who ultimately turned out to be the store manager lol. Both share a remarkable commitment to excellence and customer service, yet Denisse brought an additional warmth and personalized touch that I believe would thrive in a leadership position. Her potential for growth within Whole Foods is undeniable, and it would be a tremendous loss not to recognize and develop her capabilities further.\n\nConsidering Denisse's outstanding capabilities and the positive impact she has on customers, I strongly recommend that she be considered for a promotion. Elevating her to a managerial role would not only harness her skills for a greater purpose but also enhance the overall shopping experience for all customers lucky enough to cross paths with her. Whole Foods has the opportunity to further cultivate an exceptional employee in Denisse, and I am confident she would excel and continue to exceed expectations in a leadership capacity.\n\nIn summary, Denisse is a customer service star who should not go unnoticed.

That’s not safe, especially if you’re serving this to kids, elderly family members, or anyone with health sensitivities.\n\nI went back and raised the concern with the manager. He refused to apologize for the negligence, claimed he “wasn’t familiar with that fact” and needed to “check,” yet in the same breath offered to start covering the potatoes to reduce light exposure. That contradiction alone tells me he wasn’t being straight with me.\n\nI also asked what the plan was for training staff, so they stop casually dismissing legitimate concerns by telling customers food is “edible” when it clearly may not be. He made it clear that staff training is his thing, and the tone implied I had no right to raise that question - even though the staff gave misinformation and clearly needs better guidance.\n\nThis isn’t about the $1.50.

The Trader Joe\'s Beef Jerky Strips have been a fantastic find in our training regimen.\nWoody absolutely goes wild for these! The ""Beef Recipe"" seems to be a huge hit, making them incredibly effective for reinforcing positive behaviors, especially given that he\'s a middle-aged dog we\'re working on getting back to a healthy weight. Alongside bananas, which he also enjoys, these jerky strips provide a powerful incentive without adding too many extra calories when used strategically.\nOne of my main priorities with Woody, especially as an overweight dog, is managing his energy levels and ensuring he stays cool during our sessions. The compact size of these jerky strips means I can break them into smaller pieces for frequent rewards without overfeeding, which is crucial for calorie control. Plus, they\'re easy to carry and don\'t get messy, making them perfect for outdoor training sessions where keeping Woody comfortable and cool is paramount.\nOverall, I highly recommend Trader Joe\'s Beef Jerky Strips for anyone looking for a high-value, palatable treat for their dog, especially for those working with an overweight or middle-aged dog like Woody.

Now I assumed I because I was one of the only male customers there and I was not accompanied by anyone else, plus the store was somewhat crowded I may have looked suspicious, which I understood and told her that I was only taking pictures to send to my gf for purchase. She nodded and let me move on.\n\nNow, when I came near the jewelry section to take some pictures, she stopped me again. This time I stopped taking pictures and apologized to her. Since I was pretty much finished at this point I went up to her and apologized again for any trouble I may have caused.

I was a tourist visiting here. I quickly told her that she misunderstood and I was not the person she was talking about. I then offered to show her pictures that I took to prove that I was, in fact, not taking pictures of other people. I then showed her my camera roll. She then decided it was not enough and basically demanded to see my chat history. I was angry at this point but still decided to show her the chat history to prevent any trouble. After seeing that I did not take pictures of others, she proceeded to ignore me and did not apologize.\n\naccording to my own research there has been plenty of pictures posted online of store products, so it was obvious that the store did not have an “no camera” policy. There has even been faces of rude employees posted online. Now I am wondering why I was treated with such disrespect. I understand the need for caution in crowded retail spaces, but to be falsely accused, interrogated, and treated like a threat for simply taking product photos was deeply humiliating. I was calm and cooperative the entire time. Yet I was met with hostility and assumptions instead of a basic level of professionalism or decency. I did not even receive a basic apology from the lady.\n\nThis experience left a really bad impression on me, not just of this store, but of the brand as a whole. I came in with good intentions and left feeling targeted.

It’s a much, much more modest version of what it was. It’s a much smaller and a much calmer environment. There are never the insane berserker shopping crowds like at the old place. Now it’s just a normal shopping experience and It’s a good place to get a few things for the house; maybe snacks and a drink. If it’s basic things that you’re looking for and don’t want to spend a fortune, then this is a great option.\n\nThings in the City are constantly changing, and many much loved institutions come and go. Such was the case with the original Jack’s. But we’re lucky to have this one. I stop in pretty regularly to pick up primarily household items. Maybe it’s out of nostalgia, I don’t know.

You’ll certainly find some things that you can use.\nLong live Jacks!', 'languageCode': 'en'}, {'text': 'An elevated Dollar Tree, I love that the store is spacious and they have almost every essential available at reasonable prices.

Her exceptional professionalism and attention to detail truly stood out during my shopping experience, making a significant impact on my overall enjoyment and satisfaction.\n\nHer genuine approach to customer service set the tone for the rest of my visit. Denisse's ability to anticipate my needs and provide tailored assistance was akin to a seasoned professional, ensuring that my shopping experience was seamless and efficient. Her knowledge about the products was impressive, and she took the time to explain the benefits of the items, which was incredibly helpful.\n\nDenisse's attention to detail was evident in everything she did. Whether it was recommending complementary products, or addressing any concerns I had, her meticulous approach left no room for error. I felt confident in her guidance and appreciated her thoroughness in ensuring that my questions were answered and my needs met.\n\nWhile interacting with Denisse, it became clear to me that her skills are underutilized in her current position. She possesses a natural talent for leadership and an ability to inspire those around her. Her calm demeanor, coupled with exceptional organizational skills, would undoubtedly make her a valuable asset in a managerial role.\n\nI couldn't help but compare her to another impressive employee I encountered at the 96th Street Branch, who ultimately turned out to be the store manager lol. Both share a remarkable commitment to excellence and customer service, yet Denisse brought an additional warmth and personalized touch that I believe would thrive in a leadership position. Her potential for growth within Whole Foods is undeniable, and it would be a tremendous loss not to recognize and develop her capabilities further.\n\nConsidering Denisse's outstanding capabilities and the positive impact she has on customers, I strongly recommend that she be considered for a promotion. Elevating her to a managerial role would not only harness her skills for a greater purpose but also enhance the overall shopping experience for all customers lucky enough to cross paths with her. Whole Foods has the opportunity to further cultivate an exceptional employee in Denisse, and I am confident she would excel and continue to exceed expectations in a leadership capacity.\n\nIn summary, Denisse is a customer service star who should not go unnoticed. Her professionalism, attention to detail, and potential for a managerial role make her an indispensable asset to Whole Foods. Her dedication to providing an outstanding shopping experience deserves recognition and reward, and I urge Whole Foods to consider her for well-deserved career advancement."", 'languageCode': 'en'}, {'text': 'new to the neighborhood good selection only missing my favorite bar soap brand and detergent. really good selection anyway for a grab-and-go. overall clean and staff is really helpful and nice, Andrea at the customer service table is such a sweet heart and made me feel welcomed to my new grocery shop', 'languageCode': 'en'}, {'text': 'FOOD SAFETY ISSUE, BRUSHED OFF TWICE.\n\nI’m genuinely glad there’s a new Whole Foods Daily Shop in the neighborhood. It’s well-maintained, convenient, and has a great selection. I’ve shopped there many times and wanted to see it succeed.\n\nBut today, I noticed the potatoes looked visibly green - even before checking out, I flagged it to a staff member. I was told “it’s edible” and brushed off.\n\nWhen I got home and peeled both potatoes I purchased, I saw the green went deep under the skin, which, as anyone with basic food safety knowledge knows, can indicate high levels of solanine, a toxic compound. That’s not safe, especially if you’re serving this to kids, elderly family members, or anyone with health sensitivities.\n\nI went back and raised the concern with the manager. He refused to apologize for the negligence, claimed he “wasn’t familiar with that fact” and needed to “check,” yet in the same breath offered to start covering the potatoes to reduce light exposure. That contradiction alone tells me he wasn’t being straight with me.\n\nI also asked what the plan was for training staff, so they stop casually dismissing legitimate concerns by telling customers food is “edible” when it clearly may not be. He made it clear that staff training is his thing, and the tone implied I had no right to raise that question - even though the staff gave misinformation and clearly needs better guidance.\n\nThis isn’t about the $1.50. It’s about how both staff and management dismissed a clear food safety issue with zero accountability. I expected better - especially from a store that positions itself as a standard-bearer for quality.

But recently, the way I’ve been treated has made me feel unwelcome and frustrated.\n\nIt all seems to have shifted after a day when a woman who appeared to be homeless was standing on the public sidewalk near the entrance. She, like me, had darker brown features and politely asked me for help. I bought her an ice cream and a soda, and while I was inside gathering her items, the man behind the counter kept running in and out, yelling at her to “get away,” even though she wasn’t inside or bothering anyone. I hurried to pay since she was waiting for me, so she wouldn’t keep getting yelled at.\n\nA couple of weeks later, I came in and, after looking around indecisively, I gathered my things and sat briefly on a chair near the registers to get my payment ready. I’d been coming here for a long time, so you’d think the staff would recognize me by now — I’m in there often enough. I understand employees need to monitor the store, but this felt unnecessary for someone who has consistently supported the business. Still, an employee promptly came and told me I couldn’t sit there because “the boss doesn’t like that,” even though I was preparing to check out and wasn’t bothering anyone. I got up, paid, and left quietly.\n\nThe first bigger issue was with the hot water which happened a couple of weeks after the chair incident — I was told I had to pay, but the staff didn’t give me a price, they just told me “you’re good this time, but next time you have to pay,” so I bought and left two York bars with tap-to-pay for around $2 to cover it.\n\nAbout a week later, they told me it was 50¢ per cup because I bought the noodles somewhere else (some guy I never met before was behind the counter and made up the charge on the spot). I showed them the noodles and asked them to please have their manager stock the store with them so that I could buy it from them instead. I then tried to pay $1 by card but was told there was a $5 card minimum. I left, got change, came back, and paid in cash. They gave me chopsticks for free that time, as they had plenty of other times when I used hot water while it was free for noodles whether bought in-store or at the market across the street.\n\nLater that same day, I came in again to use the hot water. I immediately gave the guy 50¢, made my noodles as usual, and went to the register to get chopsticks — like I had done many times before. That’s when I was suddenly told I had to pay for the chopsticks because I hadn’t bought the noodles in the store. The rules and prices kept changing, and It was repeatedly and inconsistently happening to me despite always being a fair, respectful, and loyal customer.\n\nThis inconsistent treatment makes me feel disrespected, and unwelcome.

It is essential for her to understand the importance of respect and adherence to protocols.

The fishmonger and Jerome kept telling me many times that it is skinless as it is a “filet.” After confirming it many times and I asked about 4 times to make sure it is skinless.

No one picked up the phone at the shop (I called at least five times) and then I had to then stop what I was doing and try to run to the store before it closed, as basically all other kosher options were closed by that point. I was offered nothing more than an “Oops, we’re sorry” - not any discount or refund on the food I ended up purchasing - not even a refund on the delivery fee after I had to make the trip myself. I have now followed up with a manager three times with no response. Six60one cannot be relied upon to deliver food for Shabbat.

Yesterday, I was at the store to buy a pack of salmon and a few fresh vegetables to prepare for dinner. Before I purchased the salmon, I specifically quadruple checked with the fishmonger and the Fairway representative guy (Jerome?)  who is always at the store offering his assistance to the customers in the store to see if the salmon is skinless since it wasn’t stated or printed on the packet. The fishmonger and Jerome kept telling me many times that it is skinless as it is a “filet.” After confirming it many times and I asked about 4 times to make sure it is skinless. To my disappointment, the salmon’s skin was still intact and I was prepping my dinner for the night. I had to pull out the skin on my own with force as I’m not a fishmonger and experience with de-skinning the salmon, a quarter of my fish was ruined. Also, as I don’t know how to take out the skin properly, the fish was still attached with this dark layer which caused it to be extremely fishy. It was such a waste because dinner was ruined and fish was too fishy to be eaten. Today I went back to the store to pick up a fresh baked French baguette and charcuterie. I saw Jerome again and told him my disappointment with the salmon with the skin issue. I showed him the picture and he was apologetic and offered to refund for a store credit. He walked with me to two ladies at Fairway who is some sort of manager and they said there is nothing they could do. The fish does have skin and I need to ask the fishmonger at the seafood counter to take off the skin, although Jerome confirmed and told her that I was told by the store fishmonger that it is “Skinless.” I was so embarrassed and wasted my breath just talking to the useless, incompetent team of Fairway.

Maybe she didn’t  hear me which was fine since it was busy. When I was getting my change back I asked again but this time saying which cookie she would choose and just flipped the tablet and handed my change. After that I waited a few minutes (it was pretty fast and I will give the staff their cred for that) they called my name and just said here are your cookies and a bag is over there. They just put the box down and walked away quickly. I know the place is busy but they could at least haven given me a simple answer or just bagged my order.

If you a fan of super chocolate flavors you’ll like it but it’s a very strong taste.

Not a good balance and not what I was expecting. 1 out of 5\n\nOreo cookie: This one actually tasted nice, but it’s not a cookie. This is just straight up cake. I would get it again but it’s not what I was expecting in texture when I think of cookies. Super soft and I would really want to eat this with a fork and knife.\n4 out of 5\n\nChocolate chip: I believe the best way to find out how a cookie shop does their job is to leave ol’ reliable chocolate chip as the be all, end all and this definitely left me with how I felt about these cookies. The taste was there but the implementation was not. It had the same problem as the fudge, soft in the center and the edges overcooked. I dont know what’s going on with how they are preparing their cookies but I think they need to rethink their process.\n\nOverall I give this place a 2 out of 5. It wasn’t a complete disaster but they really need some better people skills. I understand they have a small area for customers and the place gets overcrowded fast but I know customer service is always important.

I decided to try two of their most popular cookies: the oatmeal raisin and the original walnut chocolate chip. Both were undeniably delicious and lived up to their reputation. The texture was exactly what you want in a cookie crispy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside. The oatmeal raisin had just the right amount of chew with plump raisins that didn’t overpower the dough, while the walnut chocolate chip had that perfect balance of rich chocolate chunks and crunchy walnuts. They’re definitely indulgent and satisfying, especially if you’ve got a serious sweet tooth.\n\nThat being said, the one drawback for me is the price. The cookies are really expensive compared to what you’d expect for a bakery treat. Sure, they’re massive in size and heavy enough to share, but at the end of the day it’s still just a cookie. Honestly, if you’re someone who enjoys baking, you could probably recreate something similar at home for a fraction of the cost.

While waiting for them to be wrapped, I asked Samantha if there were any more sunflowers. She kindly asked me to wait and said she’d check in the back. She magically returned with the most stunning sunflowers I’d ever seen—fresh, golden, and vibrant, like sunshine bundled into stems. She wrapped them with beautiful attention to detail, adding her own artistic touch to make them feel like a true gift.\n😊 A Touch of Humanity and Knowledge With a cheerful smile, Samantha shared a little sunflower lore, including the fact that they’re the national flower of Ukraine—something I hadn’t known. That moment turned a simple purchase into a meaningful encounter. She didn’t just sell flowers—she offered joy, warmth, and a touch of culture all in one.\n🌟 More Than a Transaction Samantha elevated the experience from routine to unforgettable.

Pure joy.\n\nI also had a fantastic ceviche at Don Ceviche, bursting with citrus, heat, and freshness.

That scrappy, character-filled space had a rhythm all its own. It’s gone now, and it’s not coming back, just like so many pieces of the city that get swept away in the tide of gentrification, which creeps like a slow disease both downtown and eastward. Even Dhamaka, brilliant as it is, feels like part of that paradox: a celebration of forgotten flavors in a space shaped by the very forces that erase them.\n\nStill, life moves forward. The new market is beautiful, and many legacy vendors are keeping the spirit alive. I was genuinely disappointed to find the Market Line food court downstairs closed. It added a whole other layer of discovery and community.

What to do with the tickets, where to stand for the lines (they were more groups of people than actual lines), where to pay (we thought up front, until we got there, waited, but then learned that was cash only and cards payments were in the back of the restaurant). Same with the tickets.. the cutters put both orders on one ticket, and we used that one to pay, so we had no idea that the other was needed to exit.

The shumai was packed with flavor and I enjoyed those just as much.\n\nThey’re very busy as they should be, but the line moved fast. Within 2 minutes my order was taken and I got the food very fast. The roast pork bun was $2.50 and shumai was $6.50. The menu online shows $3 and $7.50 so the prices must have recently gone down or the menu is just wrong.

Now I assumed I because I was one of the only male customers there and I was not accompanied by anyone else, plus the store was somewhat crowded I may have looked suspicious, which I understood and told her that I was only taking pictures to send to my gf for purchase. She nodded and let me move on.\n\nNow, when I came near the jewelry section to take some pictures, she stopped me again. This time I stopped taking pictures and apologized to her. Since I was pretty much finished at this point I went up to her and apologized again for any trouble I may have caused.

I was a tourist visiting here. I quickly told her that she misunderstood and I was not the person she was talking about. I then offered to show her pictures that I took to prove that I was, in fact, not taking pictures of other people. I then showed her my camera roll. She then decided it was not enough and basically demanded to see my chat history. I was angry at this point but still decided to show her the chat history to prevent any trouble. After seeing that I did not take pictures of others, she proceeded to ignore me and did not apologize.\n\naccording to my own research there has been plenty of pictures posted online of store products, so it was obvious that the store did not have an “no camera” policy. There has even been faces of rude employees posted online. Now I am wondering why I was treated with such disrespect. I understand the need for caution in crowded retail spaces, but to be falsely accused, interrogated, and treated like a threat for simply taking product photos was deeply humiliating. I was calm and cooperative the entire time. Yet I was met with hostility and assumptions instead of a basic level of professionalism or decency. I did not even receive a basic apology from the lady.\n\nThis experience left a really bad impression on me, not just of this store, but of the brand as a whole. I came in with good intentions and left feeling targeted.

The ""Beef Recipe"" seems to be a huge hit, making them incredibly effective for reinforcing positive behaviors, especially given that he\'s a middle-aged dog we\'re working on getting back to a healthy weight.

Do you ever have just such an exceptional customer service experience that you need to tell someone?\n\nShoutout to my guy Kevin here at the Apple store. What a legend. I walked straight into the belly of the consumerism beast to upgrade my Iphone as I shoot my dumb little food videos in 4k 60 fps, and it has absolutely MOGGED my storage. I need to delete every clip after posting a video. My 256 GB phone is no match for 4k 60 fps. I need that 1 TB to stay flowy.\n\nWhen I informed Kevin of my pressing issue, he gave me every last option before letting my pockets get hit for that 1TB phone: ""You should buy more Icloud storage..."" -- ""I did but now I gotta redownload everything when it\'s time to edit and that takes forever.""\n\n""You can opt to download and keep originals in your settings so they stay high quality"" -- ""I don\'t have enough storage for that..."" -- ""Okay that\'s true..."" he responded.\n\nI truly appreciate an employee looking out for a customer rather than just making a quick sale. They don\'t make them like Kev anymore.\n\nWe also just started chopping it up, and he was such a cool personable dude. He\'s been working here for 9 years... Kev not new to this!\n\nI asked him if he could get Tim Apple on the phone so I could pitch him a few ideas including a smaller iphone (3GS size) and to bring an ipod back so I could go workout and not have my phone on me... I miss disconnecting from my phone for at least 90 min a day.\n\nKev responded ""Yeah for sure! Let me just dial him up real quick"" with a cheeky grin.\n\nThe Kevins of the world need their shine.

But there was an African-American lady there whom I assumed was the manager. I was there to take some pictures for my girlfriend because she likes the brand and I wanted her to pick up a few items. Was taking pictures of products on the shelf when this lady came up to me and told me to stop. Now I assumed I because I was one of the only male customers there and I was not accompanied by anyone else, plus the store was somewhat crowded I may have looked suspicious, which I understood and told her that I was only taking pictures to send to my gf for purchase. She nodded and let me move on.\n\nNow, when I came near the jewelry section to take some pictures, she stopped me again. This time I stopped taking pictures and apologized to her. Since I was pretty much finished at this point I went up to her and apologized again for any trouble I may have caused. Now up until this point I didn’t really have a problem with what she did.\n\nShe then proceeded to accuse me of “coming here everyday and taking photos” I was dumbfounded by the accusation as this has been my first time in this store. I was a tourist visiting here. I quickly told her that she misunderstood and I was not the person she was talking about. I then offered to show her pictures that I took to prove that I was, in fact, not taking pictures of other people. I then showed her my camera roll. She then decided it was not enough and basically demanded to see my chat history. I was angry at this point but still decided to show her the chat history to prevent any trouble. After seeing that I did not take pictures of others, she proceeded to ignore me and did not apologize.\n\naccording to my own research there has been plenty of pictures posted online of store products, so it was obvious that the store did not have an “no camera” policy. There has even been faces of rude employees posted online. Now I am wondering why I was treated with such disrespect. I understand the need for caution in crowded retail spaces, but to be falsely accused, interrogated, and treated like a threat for simply taking product photos was deeply humiliating. I was calm and cooperative the entire time. Yet I was met with hostility and assumptions instead of a basic level of professionalism or decency. I did not even receive a basic apology from the lady.\n\nThis experience left a really bad impression on me, not just of this store, but of the brand as a whole. I came in with good intentions and left feeling targeted. Definitely won’t be returning to any locations by this brand and I’ll be warning others about this location.', 'languageCode': 'en'}]",East Village,store
